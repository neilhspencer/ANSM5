## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added ISBN reference to DESCRIPTION
* Added return values to print.ANSMstat() and print.ANSMtest() functions
* Removed rogue markers commenting out examples for functions kstest.ANSM(), med.test(), rng.test() and sgn.test()

N.B. I do not believe that ch3.Rd, ch4.Rd, ch5.Rd, ch6.Rd, ch7.Rd, ch9.Rd contain commented out code lines, as suggested in previous submission response
