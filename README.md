# ANSM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The ANSM package provides a number of functions to accompany the book
“Applied Nonparametric Statistical Methods” (5th edition), the revisions
from the 4th edition including a move from describing the output from a
miscellany of statistical software packages to using R. While the output
from many of the functions can also be obtained using a range of
pre-existing R functions, this package provides functions in a unified
setting and give output using both p-values and confidence intervals,
exemplifying the book’s approach of treating p-values as a guide to
statistical importance and not an end product in their own right.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ANSM like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("neilhspencer/ANSM")
```

## Example
