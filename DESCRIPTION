Description: Functions and data to accompany the 5th edition of the book "Applied Nonparametric Statistical Methods" (4th edition: Sprent & Smeeton, 2024, ISBN:158488701X), the revisions from the 4th edition including a move from describing the output from a miscellany of statistical software packages to using R. While the output from many of the functions can also be obtained using a range of other R functions, this package provides functions in a unified setting and give output using both p-values and confidence intervals, exemplifying the book's approach of treating p-values as a guide to statistical importance and not an end product in their own right. Please note that in creating the ANSM5 package we do not claim to have produced software which is necessarily the most computationally efficient nor the most comprehensive.
