Description: This package provides a number of functions to accompany the book "Applied Nonparametric Statistical Methods" (5th edition), the revisions from the 4th edition including a move from describing the output from a miscellany of statistical software packages to using R. While the output from many of the functions can also be obtained using a range of pre-existing R functions, this package provides functions in a unified setting and give output using both p-values and confidence intervals, exemplifying the book's approach of treating p-values as a guide to statistical importance and not an end product in their own right.
